# **Named Entity Recognition (NER) using CoNLL 2003 Dataset**
## Overview
This repository contains code for Named Entity Recognition (NER) using the CoNLL 2003 dataset. NER is a task of extracting entities such as names of persons, organizations, and locations from unstructured text data.

### Dataset
The CoNLL 2003 dataset consists of English and German news articles annotated with named entities. It provides labeled data for training and evaluating NER models.

### Models
I implemented several machine learning models for NER:
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)

### Results
The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score. The best performing model is then selected for inference.

### Future Work
Future enhancements to this project may include:

Fine-tuning hyperparameters for improved performance.
Adding support for other languages and datasets.
